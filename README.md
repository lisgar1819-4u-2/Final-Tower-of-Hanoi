# Final-Tower-of-Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi game with Recursive Function and no hard coding

(Goal 3+: Animation on Console/ Allegro Display without Hard Code 

Problems:
Display function on allegro that prints out the stacks from the linked
list but when put into the recursive function, it does not work. The stacks are
displayed AFTER calling the recursive function, so it proves that the function works.
 Other than that, everything else works fine. I reused the stack header class from the old assignment.
 The recursive function performs accurately with the correct number of steps
(checked with MathIsFun.com). I did not hard code so you can select the number
 of disks however you want.
